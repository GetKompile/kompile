# Kompile C Library

A small shim library for the python SDK.
This is used together with the [generate image command](../docs/generate-image-and-sdk.html)
and the [python sdk](../kompile-python)
for passing python data structures to a graalvm based
shared library generated by the generate image and sdk command.

Users should not use this directly. In order to debug further in the pipeline,
please look at the [NumpyEntryPoint.java](../src/main/resources/NumpyEntryPoint.java)

Methods of the same name are converted by graalvm to a c function call
which is invoked by this library.
